				<p>Busy Busy rabbit is on his way to a work meeting, he's
					busy as always, with only one thing, the same thing on his mind: work.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 2.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 2">
				<p>On his way, he walks past a so called cake shop. What's that?
					He only knows carrots, so he is tempted. What can be more nutrious
					than carrots. Apparently it's 'sweet and tasty', but food shouldn't
				 be fun. Food should be necessary but not fun.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 3.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 3">
				<p>But Busy was tempted by the thought: can food be fun? And with that thought
					he sat down at the shop and ordered something sweet. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 4.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 4">
				<p>It was sweet indeed. Too sweet. 
				
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 5.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 5">
				<p>He left the shop immediately and sat down in a park. Busy had to think
					and process, as always. This is not meant to be, I should be on my way to work; not 
					fooling around wasting time with sweet distractions, he thought.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 6.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 6">
				<p>Back at work he felt at home again, the peace, the numbers, the peaceful pressure
					that a job brings. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 7.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 7">
				<p>After work, as always; Busy sat down in front of the TV. and watched the same
					show as always. He knew the program, but that's how it goes. Consistency
					is key, the new is dangerous and strange. Everyday must be the same. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 8.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 8">
				<p>At 10pm sharp, as always, he lies ready to sleep. But there is one thing
					on his mind and it isn't work. The sweet distraction from before. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 9.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 9">
				<p>For the first time in years, Busy woke up tired. He had be so distracted
					and busy trying to fend off those sweet sweet thoughts, 
					keeping him from covering his full 8 hours of sleep.

		
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 10.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 10">
				<p>Once again he sat at work, but tired. So tired. And so
					distracted.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 11.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 11">
				<p>Maybe I need some more books, he thought. Books
					on numbers, on consistency, on order.
					And then, maybe through fate; he walked passed a baking book, 
					which he automatically took, without thinking.


				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 12.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 12">
				<p>He opened the book and ended up on a strange looking page:
					Recipe for Cupcakes, he read. What a strange looking sweet.
					So strange, but so tempting. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 13.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 13">
				<p>And as if struck by lightning, he headed home immediately 
					and started following instructions, he loves instructions. 
					This was fun and exciting. Maybe the new is not so bad afterall?
		 </p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 14.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 14">
				<p>And then: the taste test. And it was tasty, but not tasty enough. Time
					for adjustments. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 15.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 15">
				<p>He lined up the cupcakes and adjusted specific factors.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 16.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 16">
				<p>And holy Carrot, have 
					mercy! These new options were tasty indeed! </p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 17.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 17">
				<p>Back at work, Busy didn't feel the same. In fact Busy felt bad. Very bad.
				He was sick of these numbers and patterns and rules. He wanted 
				something else. Something fun,like yesterday. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 18.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 18">
				<p>That's where Busy exploded. No more Numbers! No more boring
					boring work! More sweet suprises, more fun! He tore his documents
					and stuffed them in the bin. He had enough!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 19.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 19">
				<p>Busy left early, which he had never done before. And decided to leave 
					his work behind him.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 20.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 20">
				<p>He walked home, feeling more free than before.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 21.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 21">
				<p>At home, he immediately turned on a TV. and tried out 
					a channel he had never tried before: the baking channel.
					He watched and watched and absorbed information like a sponge.
					He was serious about this, he was passionate, he was excited.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 22.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 22">
				<p>He was ready.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 23.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 23">
				<p>The next day after practicing and practicing, he called
					his beloved brothers and invited them for a taste test.
					The two were seriously impressed. And ready to invest.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 24.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 24">
				<p>And after a few
					weeks of looking,there he had it; his very own shop. His new home.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 25.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 25">
				<p>But his home wasn't perfect yet. So he painted and painted 
					and changed a few things.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 26.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 26">
				<p>After weeks of testing and tasting, he developed new recipes 
					and perfected the old. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 27.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 27">
				<p>He broadened his horizon and baked big cakes.
					The more sweet suprises the merrier!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 28.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 28">
				<p>And before he knew it, he had become and expert, a connoisseur,
					ready to share his inventions with the world.
				
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 29.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 29">
				<p>Customers came by, and sometimes never left. Busy 
					shared his recipes and baked more and more. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="comic-panel">
				<img src="images/Bunny 30.jpg" alt="Comic Panel 30">
